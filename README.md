## A dash to rule them all
This extension aggregates all the UI elements outside of overview on a dash. This new dash is resizable in three sizes and can be shown out of overview by pressing the mouse against a hot edge on the bottom of the primary monitor.

## ToDo list

* Add prefences window.
* Replace static icons with personalized indicators.
* Replace prevent hide based on labels with a real prevent hide.
* Check bugs on hide standard dash.
